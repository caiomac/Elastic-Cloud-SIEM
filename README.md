<h1>Elastic SIEM Setup and Monitoring </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves setting up an Elastic SIEM instance to monitor security events. It starts by creating an Elastic Cloud deployment and configuring a Kali Linux virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox. Logs are collected using the Elastic Agent installed on the VM, forwarding data to the SIEM. Security events, such as those generated by Nmap scans, are analyzed using queries in Elastic SIEM. Custom dashboards and visualizations are created to display patterns over time, and alerts are configured to notify of specific events, such as Nmap scans, via email.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
The objective of this lab is to provide a practical learning experience in setting up and utilizing Elastic SIEM for security monitoring and incident detection. By creating an Elastic Cloud deployment and configuring a Kali Linux virtual machine, the lab aims to teach skills such as cloud deployment, log collection, and SIEM integration. I learnt to generate and analyze security events, create visual dashboards to identify patterns, and configure alerts for real-time notifications of specific activities, such as Nmap scans, to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

<h2>Skills learned</h2>

- Cloud Deployment <br />
- Virtualization <br />
- Log Collection and Integration <br />
- Dashboard creation <br />
- Alert configuration <br />
- SIEM operations <br />


<h2>Tools Used </h2>

- Elastic Cloud: For deploying and managing the Elastic SIEM instance.<br />
- Elastic Agent: For collecting and forwarding logs to the SIEM.<br />
- Kali Linux: As the virtual machine for generating and testing security events.<br />
- Oracle VirtualBox: For setting up and running the Kali Linux VM.<br />
- Nmap: For generating security events through network scanning.<br />

- Email Services: For receiving notifications triggered by configured alerts in Elastic SIEM.<br />


<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<h3>Step 1 - Setting up an Elastic Account:</h3> 
Before starting, I needed to create a free account to set up a cloud Elastic instance that I could run the SIEM on. To do that, I signed up for a free trial to use Elastic Cloud at <i>https://cloud.elastic.co/registration</i>. Once I had an Elastic account, I logged in to the Elastic Cloud console at <i>https://cloud.elastic.co.</i>, clicked on the <b>Create Deployment</b> button and selected <b>Elasticsearch</b> as the deployment type. I chose a region and deployment size that fitted my needs and clicked on <b>Create Deployment</b>.

<h3>Step 2 - Setting up the Linux VM:</h3>  
<br/>
Next, I needed to set up the Linux VM. I used Kali Linux and Oracle VirtualBox. I started by downloading the Kali Linux VM from the official Kali website at <i>https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines</i>. I create a new VM with the Kali VM file in VirtualBox. 
<br/>
<br/>

</div>
I started the VM and followed the on-screen prompts to install Kali. Once the installation was complete, I logged in to the Kali VM using the credentials <b>kali</b> for both the username and password.

<h3>Step 3 - Setting up the Agent to Collect Logs:</h3>
An agent is a software program that is installed on a device, such as a server or endpoint, to collect and send data to a centralized system for analysis and monitoring. In the context of Elastic SIEM, an agent was used to collect and forward security-related events from endpoints to Elastic SIEM instance.
<br />
<br />
To set up the agent to collect logs from Kali VM and forward them to the Elastic SIEM instance, I logged in to the Elastic SIEM instance and navigate to the Integrations page by: clicking on the Kibana main menu bar at the top left, then selecting <b>Integrations</b> at the bottom.
<br />
<br/> 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/444631b9-606b-49dd-b0cf-f6b4ebbc3396" width="700">
</div>
<br />
I searched for <b>Elastic Defend</b> and clicked on it to open the integration page:
<br/> 
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<br />
I clicked on <b>Install Elastic Defend</b> and followed the instructions provided on the integration page to install the agent on your Kali VM.
<br/> 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b06fbd7-c5bc-44b9-a395-fb8cafed75f9" width="700">
</div>
<br />
I selected <b>Linux Tar</b> and then copied that command to clipboard and pasted it into the Kali terminal (command line).
<br/> 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b06fbd7-c5bc-44b9-a395-fb8cafed75f9" width="700">

</div>
<br />
Once the agent was installed, a message that says “Elastic Agent has been successfully installed.” was prompted and it automatically started collecting and forwarding logs to the Elastic SIEM instance.







<h3>Step 4 - Starting the client computer in the domain</h3>
Once everything is set now, if it’s tried to start the client computer as set of internal network, it’ll be in the domain as shown below. 
<br />

</div>
<br />
And the workstation will be connected to the internet through the domain.
<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<br />
For better management computer was renamed to WindowsPC and is already visible in DHCP and Active Directory (172.16.0.100 was another testing machine) 
<br />

<br />
Once the computer is in AD, it’s possible to login to it by using one of the user accounts created.

<h2>Summary</h2>
I had reached the end of the walk-through! With the conclusion of the last part of this step-by-step walk-through, I had a successful setup and communication between 2 Virtual Machines: Windows 10 and Windows Servers. I should also be able to automatically connect a computer to the domain once it’s in the same network as the server and sign in by using any of the accounts from the Active Directory.
